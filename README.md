# SolarCite

SolarCite is an open-source data science application **developed for the TID hackathon**. The project aims to identify renewable energy development potential in Nigeria, specifically focusing on determining suitable locations for building small-scale solar and mini-grids. By leveraging satellite data, mathematical modeling, and innovative data use tools, SolarCite provides valuable insights and analytics to support informed decision-making for renewable energy investments.

## Features

- prediction of solar energy potential in off-grid communities
- Utilization of NASA data and mathematical models for data analysis
- Frontend built with React for an interactive user interface
- APIs built with Flask for data processing and scoring computations
- Visualization of data over time and Google Maps integration for location mapping

## Extras.
- A Custom built extended version of the Nasa API is available in the Nasa-Extension Branch in this repository ðŸ˜‰

## How to Use

To use SolarCite, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend and API by referring to the respective README files.
3. Launch the frontend application by running the appropriate commands.
4. Access the SolarCite website on your localhost.
5. Enter the latitude, longitude, start date, and end date to retrieve the solar siting score for a specific location.
6. Explore the visualizations and maps provided to gain insights into renewable energy development potential.
